# MM1K Simulator

This project is a C-based simulation of an MM1K queueing system that analyzes performance under different scheduling policies and arrival rates. It uses C for the core simulation logic and Python for data visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have `gcc`, `make`, and `python3` installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- `gcc`
- `make`
- `python3`
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Building and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd mm1k-simulator
    ```

2.  **Build and run the simulation:**

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

    This command will:
    - Clean the project directory (remove old object files and binaries).
    - Compile the C source code.
    - Run the simulation binary (`bin/simulator`).
    - The simulation generates CSV results in the `results/` directory.

3.  **Generate Plots:**

    After the simulation completes, run the Python script to generate 3D plots from the results:

    ```bash
    python3 plot.py
    ```

    The generated plots will be saved in the `plots/` directory.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `bin/`: Contains the compiled binary of the simulation.
- `include/`: Contains the header files for the C source code.
- `obj/`: Contains the object files generated during compilation.
- `results/`: Contains the CSV files generated by the simulation.
- `plots/`: Contains the generated 3D plots (created by `plot.py`).
- `src/`: Contains the C source code for the simulation.

### Files

- `makefile`: The makefile for building and running the project.
- `plot.py`: A Python script that reads CSV results and generates 3D visualizations.
- `src/main.c`: The main entry point of the simulation. It sets up scenarios and runs simulations.
- `src/simulation_*.c`: Implementation of different scheduling policies (Average Lateness, Longer Wait, Round Robin).
- `src/queue.c`: Implementation of the queue data structure.
- `src/min_heap.c`: Implementation of the min-heap data structure.
- `src/statistic.c`: Functions for calculating statistics.
- `src/utils.c`: Utility functions.

## Simulation Scenarios

The simulation covers:

1.  **Arrival Rate Scenarios:**
    - `same_arrival_time_rate`
    - `low_to_high_arrival_time_rate`
    - `high_arrival_time_rate`

2.  **Scheduling Policies:**
    - `avarage_lateness` (Average Lateness)
    - `longer_Wait` (Longer Wait)
    - `round_robin` (Round Robin)

## Results

- **Metrics:** The simulation calculates metrics such as Average Response Time, Blocking Probability, Throughput, Fairness, Precision, and Recall.
- **Visualizations:** `plot.py` generates 3D surface plots to visualize how these metrics vary with queue size, service time, and other parameters.
